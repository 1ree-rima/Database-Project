#  UniLibSys â€“ University Library Database System

##  Project Title
UniLibSys â€“ A Structured Relational Database for University Library Management

##  Description
**UniLibSys** is a MySQL-based database project that models a university library system. It provides a well-structured relational database to manage books, authors, categories, student members, and borrowing activity efficiently. The schema is normalized up to 3NF and includes proper constraints and relationships.

This project is ideal for learning or demonstrating SQL database design with real-world relevance.


##  How to Run / Set Up the Project

1. **Install MySQL** (if not already installed):
   - [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

2. **Import the SQL File**:
   - Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred SQL client
   - Run the included SQL file:  
     ðŸ“„ `library_management.sql`

3. The script will:
   - Create the `UniversityLibrary` database
   - Create all required tables with appropriate constraints
   - Set up foreign key relationships



##  Tables and Relationships

| Table         | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `Students`    | University students borrowing books  |
| `Authors`     | Book authors                         |
| `Categories`  | Book classification (genres)         |
| `Books`       | Book records with inventory data     |
| `BookAuthors` | M-M linking between books & authors  |
| `Loans`       | Tracks borrow/return transactions    |

###  Relationships

- **1:M**: `Categories` â†’ `Books`
- **M:M**: `Books` â†” `Authors` (via `BookAuthors`)
- **1:M**: `Students` â†’ `Loans`
- **1:M**: `Books` â†’ `Loans`



##  ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
